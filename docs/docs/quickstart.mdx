Wave Terminal extends the terminal application you know and love with several additional features. This provides a quick overview of them and where you can look for more information.

## Terminal Multiplexing

Wave has a built-in terminal multiplexer with intuitive controls. Moving widgets around is as simple and dragging and dropping from the header bar. Resizing widgets is as simple as dragging and dropping the edges of the windows. For more information, see [Layout](/layout).

## Graphical Widgets

Being built on web technologies, Wave is capable of rendering anything that can be rendered on the web. We have taken advantage of this to create several visual widgets to enhance your productivity. They can be accessed using the widget bar on the right side of the screen. For more information, see [Widgets](/widgets).

## Custom Widgets

If you're feeling adventurous, and want to build out a more custom experience, Wave already provides a few ways to do this and we are continually adding more! For information on how to do this, see [Custom Widgets](/customwidgets).

## Connections

Wave makes it easy to access remote connection and provides the ability to integrate these with the graphical widgets we provide. By using the <i className="fa-sharp fa-laptop"/> button at the top of a widget, you are able to use that widget from the remote connection regardless of if it is a terminal or a graphical widget. For more information on how to do this, see [Connections](/connections).

## Terminal Driven Control

If you prefer controlling everything from the terminal instead of via the mouse and GUIs, we provide the `wsh` command for you to accomplish this. More details on this can be found at [wsh](/wsh).

## Configuration

Finally, if you want more control over the global experience of Wave, you can edit the your settings file to accomplish this. For information on the settings file and how to access it, see [Config](config).
